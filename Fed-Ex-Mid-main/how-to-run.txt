## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.
3. Go to Code Directory, Open Terminal, Install required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Prepare the input file (`input.txt`) containing ULD and package details. The format should be as follows:

<cost of splitting priority packages>
<number of ULDs>
<ULD_ID>,<length>,<width>,<height>,<weight_limit>
...
<number of packages>
<package_ID>,<length>,<width>,<height>,<weight>,<type>,<cost>
...

2. Run the main script:
python FedEx.py

3. Wait for the code to finish computation.

4. output.txt file will be generated.


ADDITIONAL.
1. Visualization of 3D packing will be shown on finish of output.
2. A graph representing cost optimization and volume optimization parameter to actual cost will be shown.
